                Hi there! If you clicked this page, I can assume that you're curious to know where the inspiration
                of Cloud Wine came from? Did you ever go out to dinner and order a glass of wine and immediately think 
                oh no, I definitley don't like wine, im just going to stick to my regular drink of choice? Well, I have been there and
                all it took was taking the Myer Briggs personality test to find out that I am an ISFJ. So, I stumbled upon a few articles that 
                described the qualities/traits that each kind of wine posses so I decided to match those qualities with some 
                of the Myer Brigss 16Personality test questions. Cloud Wine is a platform for new and old wine lovers to browse products ranging from
                wine glasses, wine tote bags, wine art, books about wine, and we even sell wine...yes you read that right! WE HAVE THE WINE!!!
                Cloud Wine strives to bring peace and tranquility and we truly make you want to feel like you are on Cloud Wine.
