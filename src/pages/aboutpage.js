                Hi there! If you clicked this page, I can assume that you're curious to know where the inspiration
                of Cloud Wine came from? Did you ever try  wine and immediately regret your decision because you felt 
                like maybe it just wasn't for you?  If you have ever been in that position, Cloud Wine is here to 
                help match you with a wine based off your personality. I stumbled upon a few articles that 
                described the qualities that each kind of wine posses & I decided to match those qualities with some 
                of the Myer Brigss 16Personality test questions. Cloud Wine is a platform for new and old wine lovers to browse products ranging from
                wine glasses, wine tote bags, wine art, and we even sell wine...yes you read that right! WE HAVE THE WINE!!!
                Cloud Wine strives to bring peace and tranquility and we truly make you want to feel like you are on Cloud Wine.
